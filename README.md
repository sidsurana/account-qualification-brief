# Account Qualification Brief

Assess website evidence and call notes for account qualification with source-linked review output.

Independent demonstration by Siddarth Surana, with visual/workflow references to Applied Compute. Not affiliated with, endorsed by or official software from Applied Compute. The hosted demo may use private infrastructure that is deliberately absent from this repository.

## What this demo does

- **Input:** A public HTTPS prospect website or pasted website text, plus optional fictional CRM/call notes.
- **Output:** An account qualification brief with assertions versus inference, source quotations, conflicts, missing evidence and one proposed next step; reviewed copy/PDF export.
- **Implementation and limits:** `api/source.js` and `lib/retrieve.js` implement bounded HTTPS retrieval with DNS/IP/redirect checks. `app.js` validates named-source quotations and suppresses stale/cancelled responses. The fictional example is prewritten; pressing Build requires your own AI backend. No CRM integration, outreach or autonomous action is included.

Included business records, people, transactions and evaluation examples are synthetic fixtures. Public website material retrieved at runtime is external source material, not a claim of customer access or affiliation.

## Run locally

Python 3 for a static preview and Node.js 22 or later for tests.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080. Static serving does not execute `api/` server routes. Install dependencies with `npm ci` and run `npm run build` to create `public/`. For HTTPS website retrieval, run `api/source.js` in a Node serverless runtime with these dependencies; pasted text can be inspected in a static preview. 

Run the included checks:

```sh
npm test
npm run build
```

Tests use fixtures and mocks; passing them does not mean live AI is configured. A static frontend can be inspected independently, but an AI-dependent primary action will fail without the backend described below. Node serverless API wrappers require a compatible hosting/runtime adapter, rather than a plain static HTTP server.

## Included AI components and private backend separation

**Included:** Frontend UI, synthetic examples, deterministic domain checks, readable-export helpers where used, consumer client/session/transport modules and consumer API wrappers. These consumer pieces do not constitute an operational model backend.

**Excluded:** the shared gateway server, provider API keys, gateway/session signing values, central task registrations and provider prompt executor, budget ledger/database, live session access, Vercel project IDs and deployment credentials. `.env.example` contains placeholders only. `.vercel/` and real environment files are ignored. The public hosted-demo URL above is safe to share; it is distinct from private deployment metadata.

The original hosted demo uses a separately operated authenticated AI gateway. That gateway, provider credentials, visitor signing secrets, task registrations, budget ledger and deployment links are excluded. The consumer transport in this copy points to `https://gateway.example.invalid`, a reserved nonworking address. It cannot access the author's shared model budget. AI actions fail closed without a compatible backend; do not treat prewritten examples or deterministic checks as live inference.

To self-host live AI, operate your own compatible authenticated backend, implement the fixed task contract and server-side input/output checks, apply your own usage limits, and replace the example gateway address in the consumer and mocked tests. Keep all credentials server-side. No public gateway access is supplied. A bring-your-own-key adapter is a possible later improvement and is not implemented here. `AI_GATEWAY_SECRET` is a backend protocol signing secret, not a provider API key.


For this demo, implement the input/output and validation behavior described above; keep its fixed task identity consistent between the consumer wrappers and your backend. In a self-hosted deployment, generate your own signing secrets and configure your own provider transport and accounting. Do not reuse the author's hosted-demo sessions or credentials. The frontend makes same-origin API requests; it contains no direct provider access key. Do not expose signing values in browser bundles. Deployment of this repository does not provision or enable AI.

## Data, review and limitations

Use synthetic, non-sensitive inputs. Local browser persistence is not a shared production database. Drafts require human review, and exact quotations prove a text match rather than factual truth or semantic entailment. No real customer integration or external business action is implied. Current hosted-service availability, quotas and model choice are controlled separately and are not guaranteed by this source release.
